                                <li class="pb-3">A FICO Score is a three-digit number calculated from the credit
                                    information on your credit report at a consumer reporting agency (CRA) at a
                                    particular point in time. A FICO score can range from 300 to 850. It summarizes
                                    information in your credit report into a single number that lenders can use to
                                    assess your credit risk quickly. Lenders use your FICO Scores to estimate your
                                    credit risk and how likely you are to pay your credit obligations as agreed, based
                                    on your actual borrowing and repayment history. A person with a high FICO score is
                                    more likely to receive a loan or mortgage from a financial institution. Your FICO
                                    Scores may also be used when you apply for a cell phone account, cable TV and
                                    utility services.</li>
                                <li class="pb-3">The term “tradeline” technically refers to a record of activity for any
                                    type of credit extended to a borrower and reported to a credit reporting agency. As
                                    used throughout this agreement, however, the term refers more generally to a line of
                                    revolving credit, such as a credit card, which forms the basis of the credit bureau
                                    report tradeline. The act of adding a client to another person’s tradeline consists
                                    of adding client as an “Authorized User” on that person’s line of credit, resulting
                                    in the tradeline also appearing on Client’s credit bureau report.</li>

                                    on the credit history of those private individuals. Each such Cardholder possesses a
                                    positive FICO credit score and has agreed to
                                    maintain a continually positive credit history on the accounts leased by Spark

                                        to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, in whatever medium
                                        provided, whether unmodified or modified by Receiving Party or its
                                        Representatives (as defined herein), whenever and however disclosed, including,
                                        but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information,
                                        or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance
                                        results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such

                                        shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been

                                        representatives (collectively “Representatives”) who have a need to know such
                                        Confidential Information in connection with the current or contemplated business
                                        relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and only for
                                        that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the
                                        Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement,

                                        obligations under this Agreement; (c) keep all Confidential Information strictly
                                        confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree
                                        of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not
                                        disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties

                                        hereunder is of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized
                                        dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the
                                        value of such information. The damages to Disclosing Party that would result
                                        from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be
                                        impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the

                                        dissemination of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof.
                                        Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available

                                        obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of litigation relating to this

                                        (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and

                                        (b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
                                        governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas applicable to
                                        contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving
                                        effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts
                                        located in Texas shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes
                                        arising under, or in any way connected with or related to, the terms of this
                                        Agreement and Receiving Party: (i) consents to personal jurisdiction therein;
                                        and (ii) waives the right to raise forum non conveniens or any similar
                                        objection.

                                        of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to
                                        subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        (d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the
                                        parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential
                                        Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent
                                        jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or
                                        interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it
                                        enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be
                                        enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of
                                        the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.

                                        this paragraph). All such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been
                                        given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on
                                        the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally
                                        recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and
                                        (c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing.

                                        (f) This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither party may directly or
                                        indirectly assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the
                                        prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably
                                        withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be
                                        binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors,

                                        (g) The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not
                                        prevent or in any way limit either party from: (i) developing, making or
                                        marketing products or services that are or may be competitive with the products
                                        or services of the other; or (ii) providing products or services to others who
                                        compete with the other.
